This Facebook link completes the digital profile for Space Center Brand.
Looking at this alongside the Linktree and the Launch Cart store, you now have the social, navigational, and commercial hubs for this brand. Since you are working on localSq, Shop Oahu, and Phoenix Valley, this Facebook page is a key source for "Live Data"—such as event announcements, pop-up market dates, or community check-ins that are often posted on Facebook before they hit the main website.
Here is how you can leverage this specific URL for your Python mapping projects:
1. "Live" Event Markers (localSq / Phoenix Valley)
Facebook pages are often the primary source for "Events." You can use this URL to manually or programmatically identify the location of their next pop-up.
 * Implementation: Use a Python script to check for new posts. If a post mentions a location (e.g., "See us at the Phoenix Public Market!"), you can use Geopy to get the coordinates and update your Folium map in real-time.
2. Social Proofing for Shop Oahu
For Shop Oahu, adding a social media feed or a "Follow us" link to a map popup increases user engagement.
 * Implementation: When a user clicks on the Space Center Brand icon on your map, the popup can include a direct link to this Facebook page so users can see the latest community photos or reviews.
3. Sentiment & Popularity Mapping
If you're looking to rank businesses within your apps:
 * Python Tip: You can use the Facebook Graph API (or a scraper if compliant) to pull the number of "Likes" or "Check-ins" at specific locations. This data can be used to scale the size of the markers on your Python maps—making "hotter" or more popular spots appear larger.
Are you planning to scrape the "About" section of this Facebook page to get a physical address for one of your maps, or are you just archiving these links for the project metadata?
